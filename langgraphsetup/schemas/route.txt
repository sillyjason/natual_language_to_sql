-- Join Information:
-- The `route` collection can be joined with the `airline` collection using the condition:
-- route.airline = airline.iata
-- This allows you to retrieve additional details about the airline, such as its name, callsign, and country.
-- Example SQL++ query for the join:
-- SELECT r.*, a.name AS airline_name, a.callsign, a.country
-- FROM `travel-sample`.`inventory`.`route` r
-- JOIN `travel-sample`.`inventory`.`airline` a
-- ON r.airline = a.iata;
